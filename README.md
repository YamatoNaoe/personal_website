# personal_website
My first ever personal website.
Going to be creating my first ever website during my spare time.  
The due date I have in mind is for September 23rd, 2024 as that is when I go back to school to finish up my degree.  
I have outlined the entire website on paper and will adjust as needed.  
As I progress, I will continue to update this file with each change that I make to the overall project.  
This will serve to monitor my progress throughout the developement process as well as provide insight as to my line of thinking.  

Session #1: Worked on navbar and added all html elements to the website
Session #2: Styled the navbar and adjusted images to better fit the display.  Learned how to use the object-fit property to adjust images with border-radius.  Really happy about the results!
Session #3: Finished styling the navbar and added the "about me" section to the page.  Completed styling that and will move onto the next sections in future sessions.  
Session #4: Added Dropdown menus to the respective navbar positions.  Had to mess around a lot with it to get the bar to center itself properly. Adjusted all other elements to be in line with navbar changes.
