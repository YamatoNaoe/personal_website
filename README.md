# personal_website
My first ever personal website.
Going to be creating my first ever website during my spare time.  
The due date I have in mind is for September 23rd, 2024 as that is when I go back to school to finish up my degree.  
I have outlined the entire website on paper and will adjust as needed.  
As I progress, I will continue to update this file with each change that I make to the overall project.  
This will serve to monitor my progress throughout the developement process as well as provide insight as to my line of thinking.
